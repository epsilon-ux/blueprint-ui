            <p class="mb-5 u-font-size-2">Voice and tone is as important to consistent branding as colors, UX patterns,
                and logos. It is just as jarring to find a switch in voice and tone as it is to find that a button that
                is usually blue is now red. Voice and tone is how we talk to our users, how we inform them of errors,
                successes, and alerts, how we explain concepts, and how we guide them through our product. Consistency
                in voice and tone sets the users’ expectations of how to interact with PeopleCloud products.</p>
            <h2 class="h2">Voice</h2>
            <p>
                Voice is what you're saying. Our voice doesn't change. Our voice is clear, concise, informative, and
                positive. We speak in short sentences and use simple words. We give our users the information they need
                to use our products, without frills or embellishments.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Clear</h3>
            <p>
                Use plain English. Avoid jargon, slang, buzzwords, or anything you wouldn’t say conversationally.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Concise</h3>
            <p>
                Get to the point. Use short sentences. Speak in the active voice and use positive language. Avoid large
                blocks of text and complex sentences.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Informative</h3>
            <p>
                Be as informative as possible. Put yourself in the user’s place and give them as much information as
                they need to complete their goals. Don’t be vague or reference other areas of our products without more
                description.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Positive</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">
                Phrase directions and messaging in positive language. Don’t use negative language. One way to tell
                positive from negative language is to look for words like ‘can’t’ or ‘don’t’.
            </p>
            <h2 class="h2">Tone</h2>
            <p>Tone is how you say what you say. Our tone does change from time to time. Our tone is professional,
                matter-of-fact, serious, and respectful. We are not casual, cutesy, irreverent, or enthusiastic.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Professional</h3>
            <p>
                Keep your tone professional. People use our products to get their jobs done. Avoid exclamation marks,
                exuberant language, slang, or emojis.
            </p>
            <h3 class="h3">Matter-of-fact</h3>
            <p class="mb-5">Deliver news, information, and messaging in a matter-of-fact, conversational tone.
                Contractions and
                addressing the user as ‘you’ or ‘yours’ is allowed.
