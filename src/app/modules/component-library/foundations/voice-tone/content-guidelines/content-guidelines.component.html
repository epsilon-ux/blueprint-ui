        The Epsilon product suite can be very complicated to learn how to use. Writing is one way we can guide our users through their product experience. For this reason, written content must be helpful, clear, and remain consistent across products.
      </p>

      <h2>Date & Time</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of dates and times within Epsilon products. When it comes to translation and internationalization, it is important to be consistent with our formats.
      </p>

      <h3>Date</h3>
      <p>
        Dates should always be written as numerals. This is for internationalization purposes.
      </p>

      <h4>Format</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Month and day should always appear as two digits</li>
        <li>Years should always appear as four digits</li>
        <li>MM/DD/YYYY</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>12/1/2020</li>
        <li>1/31/2019</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Time</h3>
      <p>Times can appear by themselves or attached to a date.</p>

      <h4>Format</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Single digit hours should appears a single digit</li>
        <li>Am / pm designation should appear immediately after the time; do not add a space</li>
        <li>
          Time zone can be abbreviated or spelled out, depending on the situation
          <ul>
            <li>
              If abbreviated, time zone abbreviation should be in all-caps
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Do not show seconds</li>
        <li>HH:MMam/pm time zone</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>3:30pm EST</li>
        <li>12:20am UTC</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Date & time</h3>
      <p>Dates and times often appear together in our products.</p>

      <h4>Format</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Date should always appear first</li>
        <li>Time should go directly after date separated by one space</li>
        <li>Do not show seconds</li>
        <li>MM/DD/YYYY HH:MMam/pm time zone</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>12/21/2020 11:32am EST</li>
        <li>01/31/2020 12:05pm UTC</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        There are a lot of numbers in Epsilon products. Here are some guidelines when writing with numbers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Spell out the number when it begins a sentence
          <ul>
            <li>Ten objects are being deployed.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Spell out the number when it would be weird to not. Generally, this means spelling out ordinals:
          <ul>
            <li>Third-party</li>
            <li>Second step</li>
            <li>All-in-one</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise it is completely acceptable to write the number using numerals
          <ul>
            <li>
              Enter up to 40 email addresses & customer keys to test your program with
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Numbers with commas</h3>
      <p>
        Use commas in numbers with four or more digits. Adding commas makes the numbers easier to read out and scan.
      </p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>999</li>
        <li>1,000</li>
        <li>150,000</li>
        <li>1,500,000</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Abbreviated numbers</h3>
      <p>
        It is acceptable to abbreviate large numbers when space is tight. This generally is used on charts and dashboards.
      </p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>1k</li>
        <li>20k</li>
        <li>1m</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Money and currency</h3>
      <p>
        When writing about money, US dollars, or any other currencies use the currency sign before the amount and include decimals if there is a cent amount.
      </p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>$20</li>
        <li>$20.15</li>
        <li>€1.34</li>
        <li>¥5</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Telephone numbers</h3>
      <p>Use dashes between number groups. Don't add spaces or parentheses.</p>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>800-867-5309</li>
        <li>+1-800-867-5309</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Button Text</h2>
      <p>
        Button text should be short, clear, and always contain an action. Title case should be used for button text, meaning every word should be capitalized, except smaller words (check <a class="text-primary">Case Guidelines</a>).
      </p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Use action words and keep it short</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Ampersands (&) may be used in buttons to shorten the length</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          Text may be in answer to a question within the interface, such as an 'Are you sure?' question in warning modals
        </li>
        <ul>
          <li>For example, 'Yes, Continue' or 'No, Undo' button text</li>
        </ul>
        <li>
          For primary buttons that create new objects use the format 'Create Object'
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Create Event</li>
        <li>Log In</li>
        <li>Save</li>
        <li>Save & Exit</li>
        <li>Yes, Continue</li>
        <li>No, Discard Changes</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Field Text and Placeholder Text</h2>
      <p>
        Field labels and placeholder text are crucial parts of form elements. They describe to the user the purpose of the text field, dropdown, or any other input field. All input fields should include a label and placeholder text.
      </p>

      <h3>Field text guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Be short, precise, and informative</li>
        <li>Fields that are not required to complete the action should be labeled as 'Optional'</li>
        <li>Use title case (<a class="text-primary">Case Guidelines</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Placeholder guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Placeholder text can be longer than the field label, as long as it is descriptive and to the point
        </li>
        <li>
          Depending on the situation, placeholder text can address the user (as 'you') or side-step the user entirely
          <ul>
            <li>
              If describing a large direct action, such as a create flow, use 'you'
            </li>
            <li>
              If describing a small selection or input, such as a filter, don't address the user
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use sentence case (<a class="text-primary">Case Guidelines</a>)</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Enter a point amount to reward</li>
        <li>Select a category</li>
        <li>Search by keyword</li>
        <li>Select what kind of marketing promotion you would like to create</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Abbreviations</h2>
      <p>
        Abbreviations and acronyms are a handy way to shorten long and cumbersome phrases. But, users may not understand or recognize these short-hand references at first. To fix this, spell out the full term or phrase, accompanied with its abbreviation in a parentheses, the first time it appears on a page or in an object. After this, you can use the abbreviated version of the term.
      </p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Always spell out the full phrase on first use</li>
        <li>Don't spell out file extensions</li>
        <li>
          If the abbreviation or acronym is widely well known, there is no need to spell it out
          <ul>
            <li>API, HTML, CAPTCHA, ID, certain time zones</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Time zones
          <ul>
            <li>When possible, spell out time zones, for both international and continental United States</li>
            <li>When accompanied with a selected date and time, use the time zone abbreviation</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Coordinated Universal Time (UTC)</li>
        <li>Eastern Standard Time (EST)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Positive Language</h2>
      <p>
        Use positive language over negative language whenever possible. This sets a more pleasant tone and tends to be shorter and more to the point.
      </p>
      <div class="d-md-flex">
        <div class="pr-md-3">
          <h3 class="h4">Do</h3>
          <p>This action can only be used in programs that contain its associated event.</p>
          <p>Please select a parent to view your programs.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="pl-md-3">
          <h3 class="h4">Don't</h3>
          <p>This action can't be used in programs that don't contain its associated event.</p>
          <p>Programs can't be shown because there is no parent selected.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <h2>Pronouns</h2>
      <p>
        Although, it is uncommon to refer to users or groups of users within our products, we have some very simple rules to follow when talking to or about people.
      </p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Avoid gendered pronouns and terms
          <ul>
            <li>He, she, girls, guys</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Use neutral terms, such as 'they' or 'you' or avoid addressing the user altogether</li>
        <li>Only use a gendered pronoun if it is specifically stated that that is the user's chosen pronoun</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Ampersands</h2>
      <p>
        The ampersand (&) represents the word 'and'. It originated as a ligature of the Latin word for and — 'et'.
      </p>

      <h3>Guidelines</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Do not use ampersands in paragraphs of text</li>
        <li>Use only in button labels, headers, tabs, and toggles</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Example</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Save & Continue</li>
        <li>Voice & Tone</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>File Extensions</h2>
      <p>
        If using the file extension within a sentence, capitalize the acronym. If using as a file suffix, lowercase the extension.
      </p>

      <h3 class="h4">Example</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>PDFs</li>
        <li>CSVs</li>
        <li>filename.jpg</li>
        <li>filename.png</li>
