            <h2>Grammar</h2>
            <p class="mb-5 u-font-size-2">
                Following the rules of grammar help to make our copy clear, consistent, and easy to understand. Proper
                grammar also avoids embarrassment and loss of trust from our users.
            </p>

            <h3>Active Voice vs. Passive Voice</h3>
            <p>
                When possible, always use the active voice. When in active voice, the subject of the sentence performs
                the action. When in passive voice, the subject of the sentence has the action performed to it. Active
                voice is direct, shorter, and oftentimes clearer to read. Passive voice is a softer and more round-about
                way of saying things.
            </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start mb-3">
                <div class="pr-5">
                    <h4>Active Voice</h4>
                    <p>Jane deployed the email.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="pl-5">
                    <h4>Passive Voice</h4>
                    <p>The email was deployed by Jane.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h4>When passive voice is acceptable:</h4>
            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li>To avoid referring to yourself, the system, or Epsilon / PeopleCloud</li>
                <li>When the action is more important than the subject who is performing it</li>
                <li>For example; when stating that an email is approved, the action of approval is considered more
                    important than the approver (the subject)</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Contractions</h3>
            <p>Our tone is professional, but matter-of-fact. Using contractions allows for a more conversational tone
                and keeps our products from seeming too formal or robotic. Contractions also save space and reading
                time.</p>
            <h4>Avoid awkward or antiquated contractions such as:</h4>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start mb-5">
                <ul class="pr-5">
                    <li>mustn’t</li>
                    <li>shan’t</li>
                    <li>that’ll</li>
                    <li>you’d</li>
                    <li>would’ve</li>
                    <li>you’d’ve</li>
                </ul>
                <ul class="pl-5">
                    <li>needn’t</li>
                    <li>who’ve</li>
                    <li>gotta</li>
                    <li>gonna</li>
                    <li>should’ve</li>
                    <li>it’d</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h2>Punctuation</h2>
            <p class="mb-5 u-font-size-2">Punctuation is a small but important part of proper language. Without
                consistent punctuation patterns,
                our product copy would look unprofessional, sloppy, and amateurish.</p>

            <h3>Oxford (serial) Comma</h3>
            <p>Always use the Oxford comma when writing lists of three items or more.</p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start mb-3">
                <div class="pr-5">
                    <h4>Do</h4>
                    <p>
                        Without consistent punctuation patterns, our product copy would look unprofessional, sloppy, and
                        amateurish.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="pl-5">
                    <h4>Don’t</h4>
                    <p>
                        Without consistent punctuation patterns, our product copy would look unprofessional, sloppy and
                        amateurish.
                    </p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <h3>Hyphens and Ranges</h3>
            <p>Use hyphens when writing about ranges of things.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li>Monday-Friday</li>
                <li>9am-5pm</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Em Dashes</h3>
            <p>Use em dashes to link two separate thoughts or pieces of information together in one sentence. Em dashes
                are used both in sentences and also in labels, if a label requires extra related information. Always
                insert a space before and after the em dash.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">Last three months — May 1-Aug 4, 2020</p>
            <h3>Ellipses</h3>
            <p>Use ellipses sparingly. They should only be used to signify a text overflow.</p>
            <h4>Example</h4>
            <p class="mb-5">This is an example of a description that is too long and overflows…</p>
            <h3>Period</h3>
            <p>Use periods to end sentences. Use a single space between the period and the first letter of the next
                sentence.</p>
            <h4>Exclude periods in these situations:</h4>
            <ul class="mb-5">
                <li>Inline error messages that are one sentence</li>
                <li>List items that are one sentence</li>
                <li>Option descriptions that are one sentence</li>
                <li>Helper text in certain situations</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Case Guidelines</h2>
            <p class="mb-5">We use two cases when writing for Epsilon products. Knowing which case to use depends on the
                situation. One thing’s for sure, though, NEVER USE ALL CAPS.</p>
            <h3>Title Case</h3>
            <p>Title case is the case that is least used out of the two. In general, use the following rules when
                writing in title case:</p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-start mb-3">
                <div class="pr-5">
                    <h4>Capitalize</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The first word in the title</li>
                        <li>The last word in the title</li>
                        <li>The important words in the title</li>
                        <li>Adjectives (tiny, large, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Adverbs (quietly, smoothly, etc.)</li>
                        <li>Nouns (tablet, kitchen, book)</li>
                        <li>Pronouns (they, she, he)</li>
                        <li>Subordinating conjunctions (as, so, that)</li>
                        <li>Verbs (write, type, create)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <div class="pl-5">
                    <h4>Do not capitalize</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Articles (a, an, the)</li>
                        <li>Coordinating conjunctions (and, but, for)</li>
                        <li>Short words (less than 5 letters)</li>
                        <li>Prepositions (at, by, from)</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>
            <div class="mb-5">
                <h4>When to use title case:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Button text</li>
                    <li>Field and dropdown text</li>
                    <li>Titles</li>
                    <li>H1 and H2 headers</li>
                    <li>Tab text</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <h3>Sentence Case</h3>
            <p>Sentence case is the most used case. It is the easiest case to scan quickly. When writing in sentence
                case, only capitalize the first letter of the sentence.</p>
            <h4>When to use sentence case:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>H3 headers</li>
                <li>Placeholder text</li>
                <li>Checkbox options</li>
                <li>Radio button options</li>
                <li>Select options</li>
                <li>All other ancillary text</li>
            </ul>
