  TODO: add info on the following
  - learn and use ES6
  - avoid user-agent sniffing, instead use feature detection
  - avoid document.write()
  - create empty objects and arrays using the shorthand (not new Object())
  - client side vs server side
  - client-side & server-side validation

      <p>JavaScript defines the behavior and interaction of the application.</p>
      <p>JavaScript should be used sparingly. Any and all JavaScript code should be included if, and only if, it is needed for the page to achieve the desired ends, e.g.: when a behavior or interaction cannot be achieved with HTML or CSS alone.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          JavaScript should be valid
          <ul>
            <li>
              No console errors
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript should be DRY
          <ul>
            <li>
              Be re-usable whenever possible
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript should be unobtrusive, fast, efficient, and performant
          <ul>
            <li>
              Included after careful consideration
            </li>
            <li>
              Executed only when necessary
            </li>
            <li>
              Evaluated for performance overhead, file size, and maintainability
            </li>
            <li>
              Performs only the necessary tasks without needless overhead

              Does not contain HTML, CSS, or hard-coded text content
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Writing markup (HTML) in a JavaScript file makes the content harder to find, harder to edit, and less performant
                </li>
                <li>
                  Keep text content external for translations and content management

          JavaScript should be scoped appropriately
          <ul>
            <li>
              Minimize the use of globally scoped variables
            </li>
            <li>
              Use const and let when declaring variables for better scoping and error messaging
            </li>
            <li>
              Use closures or object literals to avoid global scope
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          JavaScript should have the absence or failure of the code carefully considered
          <ul>
            <li>
              What happens if for some reason this code is missing or does not run?
            </li>
            <li>
              What happens if the code triggers an error?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Naming Conventions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Function and variable names should be descriptive of what they do or represent</li>
        <li>Boolean values should be prefixed with "is" whenever possible</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Formatting</h2>
      <p>In order to increase readability, please adhere to the following formatting standards.</p>

      <h3>Comments</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Write self-explanatory or "self-commenting" code supplemented by code comments</li>
        <li>Explain what a JavaScript file does at the top of the file</li>
        <li>Explain what a function does, and make note of required parameters and their types</li>
        <li>Explain any segments of code that could come across as confusing</li>
        <li>Mark TODOs and action items with a TODO comment</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Casing</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Variable names should be camelCase</li>
        <li>Objects, classes, and namespaces should be TitleCase</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Organization</h2>
      <p>JavaScript should exist in its own file and imported into the document via <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag at the bottom of the body. Some cases may require it to be imported in the head instead.</p>
