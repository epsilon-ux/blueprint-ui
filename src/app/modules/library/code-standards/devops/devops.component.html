      <h2 class="mt-0">Development Practices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Break down work into the smallest incremental change possible</li>
        <li>Limit work in progress to 2-3 items per person</li>
        <li>
          Pull/get the latest code every day and before starting new development
          <ul>
            <li>
              When resolving merge conflicts and checking in new code:
              <ul>
                <li>Do not rely on auto-merge features</li>
                <li>Carefully compare diffs of individual files to the latest version</li>
                <li>Ensure any unintended changes are not included</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Continually test changes throughout the development cycle
          <ul>
            <li>Testing is not a single step that happens after 'dev complete'</li>
            <li>Testing should happen through the entire development cycle: dev testing, QA testing, automated testing, accessibility testing, usability testing, performance testing, etc.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Create frequent, small pull requests/changesets that touch as few files as possible</li>
        <li>Submit pull requests/changesets for code review</li>
        <li>Address code review feedback</li>
        <li>Perform peer code reviews on the latest pull requests/changesets</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Acceptance Criteria</h2>
      <p>We recommend the follow acceptance criteria for front-end development:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Show that code is reusable and uses global components</li>
        <li>Show that code does not contain custom CSS</li>
        <li>Show that code was tested across browsers and operating systems, and with assistive technology, and the UI looks and functions as intended based on the tier</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Browser Support</h2>
      <p class="font-style-italic">This list will evolve as we receive more data. We recommend all products use Google Analytics. Contact Jamie Connor for more details.</p>
      <p class="font-weight-semi-bold">Please note: All products should be tested across browsers and operating systems, and with assistive technology (e.g.: screen readers).</p>

      <h3>Tier 1</h3>
      <p class="font-style-italic">The interface looks and functions as intended in the mockups.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Chrome</li>
        <li>Firefox</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tier 2</h3>
      <p class="font-style-italic">The interface doesn’t need to look perfect, but should function as intended. It must be readable and usable, and it should degrade gracefully.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Edge</li>
        <li>Safari</li>
        <li>Opera</li>
        <li>Recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Unsupported</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Internet Explorer
          <ul>
            <li>Microsoft says: <span class="font-style-italic">Internet Explorer is a compatibility solution. We’re not supporting new web standards for it. ... If we continued our previous approach, you would end up in a scenario where, by optimizing for the things you have, you end up not being able to use new apps as they come out. As new apps are coming out with greater frequency, what we want to help you do is avoid having to miss out on a progressively larger portion of the web!</span></li>
            <li>Epsilon sent out an email January 23, 2020: <span class="font-style-italic">Microsoft has announced a vulnerability that impacts users who browse the internet using Internet Explorer... Use another supported browser, such as Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.</span></li>
          </ul>
        </li>

      <h2>Automated Code Quality Tooling</h2>
      <p><span class="font-weight-semi-bold">Automated code quality tools are not a replacement for human code review or manual testing, but they are a great supplement!</span> Below is a list of automated code quality tools that we use and/or recommend.</p>
